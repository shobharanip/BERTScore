Over the last three years as Lead Analyst – Data Science, I spearheaded the end‑to‑end design, development and production rollout of enterprise‑grade machine‑learning solutions for trading‑risk detection. Collaborating closely with stakeholders in Risk, Operations and IT, I translated complex business requirements into scalable, reusable analytic pipelines. By packaging state‑of‑the‑art and improvised algorithms—leveraging both commercial platforms (e.g., Cloudera Data Science Workbench, AWS SageMaker) and open‑source toolkits (scikit‑learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow)—I balanced functionality with total cost of ownership, driving measurable improvements in both efficiency and accuracy.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements
	•	Solution Architecture & Reusability:
	•	Developed a modular “Analytics Toolkit” in Python that encapsulated clustering (K‑means, Isolation Forest), ensemble (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep‑learning (feed‑forward ANN) algorithms, reducing new‑project setup time by 65 %.
	•	Packaged advanced feature‑engineering workflows (rolling‑window statistics, time‑of‑day flags, moving‑average ratios) with built‑in L1/L2 regularization, achieving a 25 % reduction in false‑positive alerts.
	•	Documented standardized APIs and usage guidelines, enabling 20+ data analysts to onboard the framework in under two weeks and slashing integration effort by 40 %.
	•	Model Development & Optimization:
	•	Engineered over 50 domain‑specific features from high‑frequency trading logs, customer profiles and external market indicators.
	•	Applied K‑fold cross‑validation with automated grid‑search to tune hyperparameters across 250+ experiments, boosting overall fraud‑detection accuracy by 18 % and precision by 12 %.
	•	Validated model robustness via adversarial sampling and bootstrapped hold‑out sets, ensuring stable performance across market regimes and reducing accuracy variance by 30 %.
	•	Commercial vs. Open‑Source Evaluation:
	•	Assessed total cost of ownership for commercial ML platforms versus in‑house open‑source architectures. By adopting a hybrid deployment—cloud‑native training on SageMaker for large‑scale runs and edge scoring via Docker containers on-prem—I realized a 30 % licensing‑cost savings while preserving model throughput of 10 k transactions per second.
	•	Integrated Git‑based CI/CD in Jenkins to automate container builds, unit tests and Canary deployments; cut average deployment lead time from three weeks to under four hours.
	•	Productionization & Monitoring:
	•	Orchestrated batch‑scoring pipelines with Autosys, scheduling nightly inference jobs and incremental retraining triggers.
	•	Built custom Grafana dashboards to track real‑time data drift, accuracy, precision/recall trade‑offs and resource utilization; automated Slack alerts when key metrics dropped below 92 % of SLA targets. Over 12 consecutive quarters, the system maintained zero SLA violations.
	•	Enacted a rolling‑retrain policy: models retrained weekly on fresh data to adapt to emergent fraud tactics, leading to a 20 % uplift in capture rate for novel anomaly patterns.
	•	Knowledge Transfer & Team Enablement:
	•	Conducted 15 hands‑on workshops and code‑along sessions for risk analysts and junior data scientists, covering topics from advanced feature engineering to neural‑network fine‑tuning.
	•	Authored 200+ pages of internal documentation (architecture diagrams, “cookbook” recipes, troubleshooting guides), reducing time‑to‑productivity for new hires by 50 %.
	•	Mentored a cohort of five junior analysts, two of whom were promoted to mid‑level Data Scientist roles within a year.
	•	Cross‑Functional Collaboration:
	•	Liaised with Trading, Operations and Compliance teams to integrate real‑time risk scores into the enterprise monitoring dashboard, enabling front‑line investigators to triage alerts within minutes.
	•	Partnered with Infrastructure & Security to containerize models in Docker, integrate with Kubernetes orchestration and ensure SOC‑2 compliance for data access and pipeline governance.
	•	Coordinated periodic “risk‑hackathons” to prototype new anomaly‑detection use cases (e.g., network‑graph clustering, time‑series autoencoders) and surface high‑impact PoCs for executive review.

Business Impact
	•	Time‑to‑Insight: Accelerated project kickoff and MVP delivery from 8 weeks down to 3 weeks—a 60 % improvement—by reusing core analytic modules.
	•	Fraud Capture: Increased overall suspicious‑transaction capture rate by 22 %, offsetting potential losses of $8 million annually.
	•	Accuracy & Efficiency: Elevated average model precision to 94 % (from 80 %) and maintained recall above 91 % across three market cycles.
	•	Cost Savings: Realized 30 % lower software licensing costs through a balanced open‑source/commercial strategy; reduced cloud‑compute spend by 18 % via optimized batch scheduling.
	•	Stakeholder Satisfaction: Earned a “Business Excellence” award from senior risk executives for delivering a production‑ready solution 3 months ahead of schedule and under budget.

Throughout this three‑year tenure, I consistently implemented innovative analytics, debugged complex edge‑case failures, improved throughput and accuracy, and collaborated effectively across business and technical teams—packaging advanced algorithms into reusable assets that empowered a larger pool of analysts to deliver rapid, high‑impact solutions.












The Lead Analyst – Data Science will develop analytic & machine learning models using a combination of state-of-the-art or improvised approaches, using either commercial or open source tools to balance functionality and cost to client. S/he will develop approaches that can be re-used across projects, by packaging advanced analytic algorithms in a way a larger pool of analysts can apply in their client business problems








Project description:
The objective of the project is to identify risk/anomalies in trading by carrying out data analytics using machine learning / AI techniques. The project involves analyzing past customer trading patterns to predict future high‑risk transactions. Anomaly detection is carried out by segregating and clustering highly suspicious data. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to uncover unusual customer behavior for further investigation. Historical data is ingested from Hive (distributed file systems) via SQL queries—Oracle DB and Apache Spark have been removed from scope. A secondary Spanish‑text evaluation pipeline computes BLEU, ChrF, ChrF++ and BERTScore metrics to capture any language‑based risk indicators.

The project also uses statistical methods, regularization (L1/L2) and AI tools to automate processes within the Risk Analytics team and deliver smart solutions to business challenges. Potentially fraudulent transactions are flagged to enable risk analysts to probe them thoroughly.

The project involves
i) Extracting raw trading records from Hive using SQL queries
ii) Preprocessing data to remove noise and irrelevant fields
iii) Implementing rule‑based filters to catch known fraud patterns
iv) Carrying out feature engineering (e.g., rolling‑volume, time‑of‑day, derived ratios) and applying regularization methods to strengthen predictor variables
v) Subjecting cleaned data to unsupervised (K‑means clustering, Isolation Forest) and supervised (Random Forest, deep‑learning ANNs) algorithms
vi) Using K‑fold cross‑validation with grid search to select the best algorithm and hyperparameters
vii) Deploying the final model on a GPU server via PyCharm, triggering periodic batch scoring jobs through Autosys
viii) Continuously monitoring performance; retraining automatically when metrics fall below preset thresholds
