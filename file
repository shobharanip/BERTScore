iOver the course of the initial phase I immersed myself fully in the project context by engaging directly with business stakeholders from the Risk team as well as subject matter experts in Trading Operations and Compliance in order to establish a crystal clear understanding of the overall problem statement and to translate high level business needs into detailed technical requirements. Beginning with the Statement of Work and any existing proposals or charters I conducted in depth scoping sessions in which I walked through each line item piece by piece and solicited clarifying questions on process flows business rules data availability and existing reporting gaps. I then hosted a series of workshops with cross functional participants to map current state data pipelines end to end identifying every source system every transformation rule and every downstream consumer of the data including dashboards and alerting systems. During these sessions I documented every data entity with sample volumes update frequency retention requirements and data quality thresholds. I created swimlane diagrams to illustrate dependencies between Trading Operations data capture processes and the centralized data lake ingestion pipelines in Hive to ensure that there were no blind spots or undocumented handoffs.

As ambiguities emerged around certain data definitions such as the exact definition of a “filled order” versus a “partially filled order” and how cancelled transactions should be handled in the event of rapid retries I drafted detailed request for information tickets and coordinated rapid turnaround calls with platform engineers and risk analysts to lock down each nuance. At the conclusion of this collaborative process I authored a comprehensive Requirements Specification document that consolidated business objectives acceptance criteria data source catalogs transformation logic and key performance indicators. Each requirement was assigned a unique identifier and cross referenced with the appropriate business owner sign off. To formalize any late emerging scope changes I prepared well structured Change Request documents that captured the revised deliverable description assumptions dependencies effort estimates and updated timelines. The CRs were circulated through the project governance board and received formal approval in a record time two day cycle.

In parallel I conducted an independent feasibility assessment to validate that all required data elements could indeed be extracted via Hive queries using SQL and that performance SLAs could be met without excessive cluster load. I presented my findings in a risk versus reward matrix illustrating any potential trade offs between data freshness transformation complexity and query latency. This analysis formed the basis for several design decisions in the next phase and ensured that the project plan would realistically align with both business expectations and technical constraints. By the end of the Requirement Gathering and Analysis phase all stakeholders had a unified view of scope deliverables success criteria and a jointly agreed schedule. The project had a solid foundation of documented requirements end to end process maps and governance artifacts that provided complete traceability from original business need through to final delivery.





Fifty percent Data Analytics and Model Development involves the systematic extraction transformation and modeling of trading records to detect anomalies and high risk transactions. The process begins by extracting raw trading data from the Hive SQL data warehouse using optimized SQL queries that target only the necessary fields and apply dynamic date based partition filters. Large scale extracts are scheduled during off peak hours to minimize cluster load and each extract operation logs metadata such as extraction timestamps row counts and query performance metrics to support lineage tracking and auditing requirements. Once the raw data is ingested it is loaded into a staging area where a data cleansing workflow runs. This workflow normalizes timestamp formats to a single timezone standard and validates field types and constraints against the expected schema. Missing values are identified by combining domain rules and statistical thresholds so that fields like trade price are imputed using the median price for the same instrument on the same day while missing volume entries are filled using mean or mode substitution depending on distribution characteristics. Outliers in numeric columns are detected via percentile based thresholds so that values beyond the ninety ninth or below the first percentile are either clipped at the threshold or removed if they stem from data entry errors. Duplicate records are found by composite key matching on account instrument and timestamp and are de duplicated to ensure data quality.

After cleansing the data moves to the preprocessing stage where categorical variables are converted into numerical features using one hot encoding and target encoding guided by historical risk patterns. Numerical variables are scaled to a unified feature space using min max normalization or z score standardization to prevent features with large ranges from dominating model learning. Remaining missing values are handled with model based imputation when simple methods prove insufficient. The resulting dataset is then split into training validation and test subsets using stratified sampling to preserve the ratio of anomaly labels. Each split is verified with domain experts to ensure correct representation of fraud patterns and each dataset version is tagged in an artifact registry for reproducibility.

Feature engineering is critical to capture temporal and behavioral signals in trading activity. Rolling window aggregates compute features such as average trade count and average trade volume over intervals of five fifteen and sixty minutes for each account. Temporal flags for hour of day day of week and market session are added to reflect cyclical patterns. Velocity metrics measure price change over sliding windows divided by time to detect rapid market movements. Interaction features such as the ratio of trade count to account equity highlight abnormal transaction sizing relative to capacity. High cardinality variables like instrument symbols are managed via feature hashing to compress the space while retaining variability. Dimensionality reduction techniques including principal component analysis and feature selection based on information gain and mutual information further refine the feature set.

To prevent overfitting and improve generalization models are trained with L1 and L2 regularization. Regularization strengths are determined by grid search within a cross validation framework and learning curves guide the selection of optimal coefficients that balance bias and variance. Each experiment is documented and tracked to record the impact of regularization on model complexity and performance.

With the feature set finalized the workflow proceeds to unsupervised modeling. K means clustering groups similar transactions into behavioral clusters with the optimal number of clusters determined by the elbow method and silhouette analysis. Isolation forest models detect anomalies by isolating records through random partitioning and contamination parameters are tuned to control sensitivity. Anomaly scores from these methods are aggregated into a unified risk ranking.

Supervised classification follows using ensemble and neural networks. A random forest classifier trains multiple decision trees on bootstrapped samples and tunes hyper parameters such as number of trees tree depth and minimum samples per leaf through grid search and cross validation to optimize precision recall and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. An artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers captures complex nonlinear relationships between features and the target label. The network is trained using mini batch gradient descent with optimizers such as Adam and employs early stopping to prevent overtraining. Training progress is logged per epoch and the best model checkpoint is retained based on validation performance.

Every model is evaluated on a holdout test set where metrics such as accuracy precision recall F one score false positive rate and calibration plots are calculated. Model interpretability is provided by computing shapley values for each feature and generating partial dependence plots to illustrate marginal effects. The best performing model is selected based on business criteria that emphasize low false positive rates alongside high detection rates.

Finally Spanish text evaluation is performed on unstructured comment fields. Text is cleaned lowercased and tokenized with custom stop word lists tailored to financial jargon. Translation quality and semantic similarity metrics including bleu chrf chrf double plus and bert score are computed to produce additional text derived risk features. These features are integrated into the final ensemble risk scoring pipeline.

All code and experiments are version controlled in Git and tracked via an experiment management system to ensure full reproducibility and auditability in both development and production environments. Continuous integration pipelines automate nightly retraining deployments and ensure consistent execution of the entire analytics workflow.







Twenty percent of the overall project time is dedicated to project management planning and tracking. In this phase the primary goal is to ensure that every aspect of the project is organized scheduled and controlled from inception through completion. By establishing a clear framework for governance communication and accountability the team can maintain alignment with business objectives stakeholder expectations and technical constraints. The planning and tracking activities in this phase serve as the backbone of the project structure providing a reliable roadmap that balances deliverable quality resource availability and timeline demands. These efforts lay the foundation for proactive identification of potential issues and timely corrective measures.

To build and maintain a comprehensive schedule the planning team develops both a macro level timeline that outlines major milestones deliverable due dates and governance checkpoints and a micro level breakdown that details individual tasks dependencies durations and assigned responsibilities. The macro level view highlights phase boundaries testing and review windows deployment readiness and stakeholder sign off gates. The micro level view decomposes each phase into work packages and activities tracking start and end dates task interdependencies and resource requirements. Together these views enable visibility at strategic and operational levels facilitating cross functional coordination and ensuring that every task contributes to the project goals.

Managing requirement changes is integral to maintaining project alignment with evolving business needs and emerging constraints. A structured change control process is implemented to capture evaluate and approve all proposed modifications to scope timeline or resource allocations. Each request is documented with a clear description rationale impact analysis and cost estimation. Impact assessments include analysis of adjusted deliverable timelines resource reallocations and potential risks. Change requests are reviewed in a governance forum where representatives from business and technical teams discuss feasibility and priority. Upon approval the schedule artifacts resource plans and communication strategies are updated and distributed to all stakeholders to ensure transparency and minimize disruptions.

Resource allocation is meticulously coordinated to align personnel skills capacity and availability with the demands of each work package. The project manager collaborates with functional leads to assign team members to tasks based on expertise role expectations and effort estimates. Resource tracking tools record planned assignments actual utilization and availability windows. Cross training guidelines and backup assignments are established to mitigate single point of failure risks. When demand peaks exceed capacity the team explores options such as reprioritizing non critical tasks engaging additional temporary staff or adjusting timelines. Clear visibility into resource allocation supports balanced workloads high morale and efficient delivery.

Progress monitoring involves frequent status updates milestone reviews and performance metrics that measure adherence to schedule quality standards and budget targets. The project manager collects status reports from task owners aggregates progress data and compares actual performance against the baseline plan. Variance analysis identifies tasks that are ahead behind or at risk of slippage. Key performance indicators include schedule adherence percentage earned value metrics and completion ratios. Concurrently the team conducts risk assessments to identify potential obstacles emerging dependencies or external factors that could impact delivery. A risk register is maintained to document risk details likelihood impact and mitigation plans. Regular risk review meetings help the team prioritize risks and update response strategies accordingly.

When deviations occur corrective actions are implemented immediately to realign the project with its objectives. Root cause analysis determines whether slippage or issues arise from resource constraints requirement misunderstandings technical blockers or quality concerns. Corrective measures include re sequencing tasks reallocating resources intensifying stakeholder engagement and refining processes or communication protocols. If necessary the team escalates high severity issues to a steering committee for rapid decision making and resolution. Updates to the schedule and resource plans are communicated to all relevant parties with clear action items owners and deadlines. This disciplined approach to tracking and recovery ensures that deliverables are completed on time on scope and within budget while maintaining confidence and trust among project stakeholders.





Ten percent Quality Management and Assurance This phase focuses on implementing and maintaining a robust quality framework that covers code deliverables documentation and model outputs to ensure they meet or exceed customer expectations and internal standards. A key activity is the development and application of standardized review checklists that guide every code inspection and document audit. These checklists are created in collaboration with stakeholders from development data science and operations teams to capture best practices coding standards documentation requirements and compliance criteria. Each checklist item is clearly defined with examples acceptance criteria and linked to relevant coding or documentation guidelines to remove ambiguity and promote consistency across all reviews.

The code review process begins with automated static analysis tools that scan new code merges for issues such as unused variables complexity spikes security vulnerabilities and deviations from style conventions. Reports generated by these tools feed into the review workflow and highlight areas requiring manual inspection. Peer reviewers then examine the code changes line by line to verify correctness readability maintainability and adherence to architectural patterns. Reviewers focus on verifying that each function and module includes unit tests or integration test stubs where applicable that cover normal operation edge cases and error conditions. Coverage reports are produced for each merge request to ensure no critical logic paths are left untested. Review outcomes are tracked in a review dashboard that records reviewer comments defect types severity ratings and resolution status. This feedback loop not only resolves immediate defects but also informs updates to the checklist and training materials to prevent recurrence of common issues.

Documentation reviews are conducted in parallel to code reviews. Technical writers data scientists and engineers collaborate to ensure that design documents implementation guides and user manuals are complete accurate and up to date. Reviewers verify that each document includes a clear description of system components input output data schemas and expected behaviors. For model documentation the team checks that model training datasets feature definitions hyperparameter settings and validation results are fully documented and version controlled. A runbook template is used to capture deployment steps rollback procedures monitoring alerts and escalation contacts. Documentation review metrics such as number of errors per page review duration and time to resolution are tracked to measure process efficiency and identify areas for improvement.

Validating model outputs against quality criteria is another critical activity. A series of test suites is executed that compare model predictions against known ground truth datasets to calculate metrics such as accuracy precision recall false positive rate and calibration error. Performance tests measure inference latency resource utilization and throughput under simulated production loads. Data drift tests compare the statistical distribution of incoming data against training data baselines to detect significant shifts that could degrade model performance. When test results fall outside of defined acceptance thresholds automated alerts notify the quality team and trigger root cause investigations. Detailed test reports are generated that summarize metric trends historical performance and specific failure cases. These artifacts serve as both evidence of quality and inputs for continuous improvement discussions.

Iterative refinement of the review processes is driven by regular retrospectives held after each sprint or release cycle. The quality team analyzes metrics from code and documentation reviews test results and defect trends to identify bottlenecks and failure modes. Root cause analysis techniques such as five why and fishbone diagrams are employed to trace defects back to process gaps training needs or tooling deficiencies. Action items are then defined to update checklists refine review guidelines enhance training sessions or adjust automation rules. Changes are tracked in a quality improvement backlog with assigned owners deadlines and review criteria. The impact of each change is monitored through key quality indicators so that the team can measure progress and demonstrate tangible improvements over time.

Throughout this phase communication plays a vital role in maintaining alignment and transparency. Weekly quality reports are distributed to project leadership and stakeholders highlighting review coverage metrics defect counts resolution times and test coverage statistics. A shared quality dashboard provides real time visibility into the health of codebases documentation repositories and production models. Quarterly quality audits are conducted by a cross functional quality council to validate compliance with internal policies external regulations and customer service level agreements. Findings from these audits feed into strategic quality planning and risk management activities.

By conducting thorough code and documentation reviews validating model outputs against rigorous criteria and continuously refining processes based on data driven insights this Quality Management and Assurance phase ensures that final deliverables are reliable maintainable and aligned with customer quality expectations.






Ten percent Customer Relationship Management
This phase focuses on fostering strong partnerships with all project stakeholders by maintaining proactive communication managing expectations and ensuring continuous alignment with business goals throughout the entire project lifecycle. At the outset a stakeholder register is created that documents each individual or group with their roles interests influence and communication preferences. By mapping stakeholders to their responsibilities and preferred channels the team can tailor updates and engagement activities to meet their needs and maximize buy‑in.

A comprehensive communication plan is developed that schedules regular touch points including weekly status calls monthly executive briefings and ad hoc deep‑dive sessions when critical milestones are reached. Each update covers progress against key deliverables upcoming decisions dependencies and potential concerns. Visual dashboards display high‑level summaries and drill down into specific areas on demand. Meeting agendas are circulated in advance with clear objectives and follow up action items are tracked in an issue log that assigns owners deadlines and resolution status. This disciplined cadence helps stakeholders feel informed and reduces the risk of surprises that could derail project momentum.

Soliciting periodic feedback is essential to capture stakeholder sentiment validate assumptions and uncover new requirements or constraints. At the end of each major phase the team conducts structured feedback surveys and one‑on‑one interviews to gather input on process effectiveness communication clarity and solution fit. Feedback is analyzed to identify recurring themes and priority areas for improvement. Results are shared transparently with stakeholders along with an action plan that addresses top concerns. By demonstrating that input is valued and acted upon the team builds trust and fosters a collaborative culture.

Anticipating risks and challenges requires ongoing environmental scanning and scenario planning. The team hosts periodic risk workshops that bring together stakeholders subject matter experts and technical leads to brainstorm emerging threats such as market shifts regulatory changes or data source disruptions. Each workshop captures potential risks in a risk register with assessments of likelihood impact and proposed mitigation strategies. Mitigation plans range from contingency resource pools and backup data feeds to rapid decision protocols. Risk owners are assigned accountability for monitoring triggers and executing responses if warning signs appear.

When issues or new challenges arise the team proposes practical solutions in a timely fashion. For example if a critical data feed is delayed the team may recommend reordering the deployment schedule or deploying a temporary model based on alternate data. If stakeholder priorities shift the team assesses trade offs between scope quality timeline and cost then presents options with clear recommendations. All solution proposals include impact analyses and updated schedules so decision makers can quickly weigh the benefits and risks. This agile approach to problem solving ensures that the project remains resilient in the face of change.

Maintaining continuous engagement and satisfaction involves more than reactive communication. The team organizes periodic demonstrations of working functionality such as model scoring dashboards or reporting templates. These live demos allow stakeholders to see progress first hand ask questions and suggest refinements while there is still time to adjust direction. In between formal sessions informal updates such as email newsletters project blog posts or brief video recaps keep momentum alive and reinforce shared ownership. Post delivery the team conducts a lessons learned review that celebrates successes captures best practices and highlights areas for growth. By closing the feedback loop and incorporating insights into future efforts the project not only meets its objectives but also leaves stakeholders confident in the team’s ability to deliver value on subsequent initiatives.

Project description:
The objective of the project is to identify risk/anomalies in trading by carrying out data analytics using machine learning / AI techniques. The project involves analyzing past customer trading patterns to predict future high‑risk transactions. Anomaly detection is carried out by segregating and clustering highly suspicious data. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to uncover unusual customer behavior for further investigation. Historical data is ingested from Hive (distributed file systems) via SQL queries—Oracle DB and Apache Spark have been removed from scope. A secondary Spanish‑text evaluation pipeline computes BLEU, ChrF, ChrF++ and BERTScore metrics to capture any language‑based risk indicators.

The project also uses statistical methods, regularization (L1/L2) and AI tools to automate processes within the Risk Analytics team and deliver smart solutions to business challenges. Potentially fraudulent transactions are flagged to enable risk analysts to probe them thoroughly.

The project involves
i) Extracting raw trading records from Hive using SQL queries
ii) Preprocessing data to remove noise and irrelevant fields
iii) Implementing rule‑based filters to catch known fraud patterns
iv) Carrying out feature engineering (e.g., rolling‑volume, time‑of‑day, derived ratios) and applying regularization methods to strengthen predictor variables
v) Subjecting cleaned data to unsupervised (K‑means clustering, Isolation Forest) and supervised (Random Forest, deep‑learning ANNs) algorithms
vi) Using K‑fold cross‑validation with grid search to select the best algorithm and hyperparameters
vii) Deploying the final model on a GPU server via PyCharm, triggering periodic batch scoring jobs through Autosys
viii) Continuously monitoring performance; retraining automatically when metrics fall below preset thresholds
